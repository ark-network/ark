# Ark Coordinator

The Coordinator handles the perpetual creation of new Ark rounds every 5 seconds.

It can be served in one of the following ways:

* [Dockerized application](run-docker.md)
* [Standalone application](run-standalone.md)

<!-- any dependency? -->

Once your coordinator is up and running you can [configure the CLI](configure-cli.md) to interact with it.
