# Welcome to Ark

A second-layer solution designed to scale Bitcoin transactions

<Buttons />

## Why Ark?

Bitcoin is the world's most secure and censorship-resistant blockchain. However, it's not the fastest or the cheapest. Ark is a second-layer solution designed to scale Bitcoin transactions. It uses a shared UTXO model for confidential and off-chain payments through an intermediary server that cannot access your funds.

## Try it

Start by downloading a compatible binary.

### Available binaries

- [ark-darwin-amd64](https://install-latest-cli.arkdev.info/latest-release/ark-darwin-amd64)
- [ark-darwin-arm64](https://install-latest-cli.arkdev.info/latest-release/ark-darwin-arm64)
- [ark-linux-amd64](https://install-latest-cli.arkdev.info/latest-release/ark-linux-amd64)
- [ark-linux-arm64](https://install-latest-cli.arkdev.info/latest-release/ark-linux-arm64)

Move it to somewhere on your PATH:

```bash
$ mv <file> /usr/local/bin/ark
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ark
```

### Configure the CLI

The CLI requires an initial setup to initialize the wallet and connect to the ASP:

```bash
$ ark init --password <password> --ark-url https://asp.arkdev.info
```

You can also restore a wallet by specifying the hex encoded private key with the `--prvkey` flag.

### Receive VTXO

You can print your onchain and offchain receiving addresses to receive funds with:

```bash
$ ark receive
```

This command also shows the list of relays used to reach the ASP.

### Print balance

You can see both the onchain and offchain balance of the wallet with:

```bash
$ ark balance
```

### Send VTXO(s)

You can make an offchain payment by sending to either one or many receivers:

```bash
$ ark send --to <ark_address> --amount <amount>
$ ark send --receivers '[{"to": "<ark_address>", "amount": <amount>}, ...]'
```

The amount must be specified in _sats_ unit.

### Collaborative redemption

You can redeem onchain your funds by collaborating with the ASP with:

```bash
$ ark redeem --address <onchain_address> --amount <amount>
```

Any change produced with this operation goes to your offchain address.

### Unilateral redemption

If the ASP is unresponsive you can redeem all your offchain funds unilaterally with:

```bash
$ ark redeem --address <onchain_address> --force
```
