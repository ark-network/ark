## Intervenients

### ASP

ASPs are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work.

### Users

Any user that onboards the Ark or receives a payment inside an Ark.

### VTXO

Ark has a UTXO set that lives off the chain. These utxos are referred to as virtual UTXOs or VTXOs in short.

## Moments

### Boarding the Ark

When a User sends funds to the Ark and gets VTXOs in return.

### Unilateral exit

When a user decides to withdraw his funds from the Ark to mainchain, without asking the ASP for permission.

### Round

Periodic transaction crafted by the ASP that hits mainchain and creates new VTXOs.

## Transactions

**Note:** In an optimistic scenario, transactions marked with a **\*** should never hit onchain.

### Funding transaction

- When Alice wants to enter the Ark

| Inputs              | Outputs (locking script)            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Aliceâ€™s segwit UTXO | `(Alice + ASP) or (ASP in 1 month)` |

### Redeem transaction\*

- Insurance for Alice, in case the ASP becomes unresponsive.
- Allows Alice to receive funds back from the Ark after a grace period ie. 24 hours

| Inputs                                     | Outputs                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Funding transaction spending `Alice + ASP` | `(Alice + ASP) or (Alice in 24 hours)` |

### Forfeit transaction\*

- Insurance for the ASP, in case Alice tries to double spend her VTXO after spending it inside Ark
- Before the ASP funds Bobâ€™s VTXO in the next Pool transaction, he must receive this transaction signed by Alice
- Uses a connector from the next Pool transaction to achieve atomicity

| Inputs                                    | Outputs |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Redeem transaction spending `Alice + ASP` | `ASP`   |
| Connector from next Pool transaction      |

### Pool transaction (aka Ark transaction)

- Funded by the ASP, creates VTXOs
- After 4 weeks, the ASP can get their funds back
- Multisig `n-of-n` where `n` is the number of participants
- A new transaction is broadcasted every 5 seconds

| Inputs   | Outputs                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ASP UTXO | Shared output: `n-of-n or (ASP in 1 month)` |

### Shared output (aka Shared UTXO)

- Represents a binary tree of transactions
- In an optimistic scenario, this tree is never revealed

### VTXO\*

- Similar to Redeem transaction
- Can be broadcasted anytime, on the condition that previous transactions on the transaction tree (up to the Pool transaction) are confirmed or broadcasted at the same time

| Inputs                                  | Outputs                                |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Previous transaction on the binary tree | `(Alice + ASP) or (Alice in 24 hours)` |
