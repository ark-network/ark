## Intervenients

### ASP

ASPs are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work.

### Users

Any user that onboards the Ark or receives a payment inside an Ark.

### VTXO

Ark has a UTXO set that lives off the chain. These utxos are referred to as virtual UTXOs or VTXOs in short.

## Moments

### Boarding the Ark

When a User sends funds to the Ark and gets VTXOs in return.

### Unilateral exit

When a user decides to withdraw his funds from the Ark to mainchain, without asking the ASP for permission.

### Round

Periodic transaction crafted by the ASP that hits mainchain and creates new VTXOs.

## Transactions

### Notes

- In an optimistic scenario, transactions marked with a **\*** should never hit onchain.
- All time periods used on timelocks (**5s**, **24h**, **4w**, **1y**) are arbitrary: any ASP can use different values.

### Legend

- **A**: Alice pubkey
- **ASP**: ASP pubkey
- **cov\*\*(script)**: covenant that forces the spending transaction to have a mandatory first output with the **script**
- **and(A,B)**: both conditions needed to unlock
- **or(A,B)**: only one condition needed to unlock
- **and(A, or(S, after(24h)**: (Alice and Server) or (Alice after 24h)

### VTXO\*

- A Virtual UTXO: it looks like an UTXO but it should never hit onchain, thus a Virtual UTXO

| Inputs                       | Outputs                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Boarding or Pool transaction | `(Alice + ASP) or (Alice after 24h)` |

### Boarding transaction

There are 2 different ways a user can board the Ark:

- With luggage
- Without luggage

Different ASPs can use different ways for users to board their Ark.

#### With luggage

- Initially proposed by [Steven Roose](https://roose.io/presentations/understanding-ark.pdf)
- Alice funds an output that can be **accepted as a VTXO** in a future round
- A covenant forces the creation of an output with the same script as [**VTXO**](#VTXO). No need for interactivity after funding it, anyone can spend.
- **ASP** can unlock after a timeout ie. _4 weeks_
- Alice is **required to be online** to maintain access to funds: after the timeout, ASP becomes the only owner funds

| Inputs       | Outputs                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aliceâ€™s UTXO | `(ASP after 4w) or cov((Alice + ASP) or (Alice after 24h))` |

#### Without luggage

- Initially proposed by [Burak](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-May/021694.html)
- Alice funds an output that can be **accepted as a VTXO** in a future round
- If ASP is not cooperative, **Alice** can unlock after a timeout ie. _1 year_
- Alice is **not required to be online** to maintain access to funds: after the timeout, she becomes the only owner of the funds

| Inputs       | Outputs                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Aliceâ€™s UTXO | `(Alice after 1y) or (Alice + ASP)` |

### Forfeit transaction\*

- Insurance for the ASP, in case Alice tries to double spend her VTXO after spending it inside Ark
- Before the ASP funds Bobâ€™s VTXO in the next Pool transaction, he must receive this transaction signed by Alice
- Uses a connector from the next Pool transaction to achieve atomicity

| Inputs                               | Outputs |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| VTXO spending `Alice + ASP`          | `ASP`   |
| Connector from next Pool transaction |

### Pool transaction (aka Ark transaction)

- Funded by the ASP, creates VTXOs
- Has at least two outputs:
  - A shared output with a VTXOs tree
  - A connectors output with a connectors tree
- A new transaction is broadcasted every 5 seconds

| Inputs   | Outputs           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| ASP UTXO | Shared output     |
|          | Connectors output |

### Shared output (aka Shared UTXO)

- Represents a binary tree of transactions
- In an optimistic scenario, this tree is never revealed
- Each leaf on this tree represents a VTXO

```mermaid

    subgraph Onchain
        shared(Shared output)
    end
    subgraph Virtual
        tx1(TX 1) --> tx2(TX 2)
        tx1 --> tx3(TX 3)
        tx2 --> v1(VTXO 1)
        tx2 --> v2(VTXO 2)
        tx3 --> v3(VTXO 3)
        tx3 --> v4(VTXO 4)
    end
    shared --> tx1
```
