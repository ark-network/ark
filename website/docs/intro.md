### What is Ark?

Ark is a second-layer solution designed to help scale Bitcoin transactions by using a shared utxo model that enables anonymous, off-chain payments through an untrusted intermediary called the Ark Service Provider (ASP). ASPs are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work.

Ark is a scaling category of its own and is not a state channel design or a rollup. Ark is a liquidity network like Lightning that operates without introducing liquidity constraints or a direct link between the sender and receiver. It uses virtual utxos, to enable anonymous, scalable, off-chain payments.
