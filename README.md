## Usage Documentation

For a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use Ark, please visit our [Developer Portal](https://arkdev.info).
For a quick-start with Docker, head over to our [Quick Start guide](https://arkdev.info/docs/quick-start/overview) where you can setup an Ark Server and Clients in a local Bitcoin regtest network.

## Repository Structure

- [`api-spec`](./api-spec/): Ark Protocol Buffer API specification
- [`client`](./client/): `ark` Single-key wallet CLI for interacting with the server
- [`common`](./common/): Shared code between the server and client
- [`pkg/client-sdk`](./pkg/client-sdk/): Go SDK for interacting with servers running the Ark protocol. It offers WASM bindings to interact with the SDK from the browser and other environments.
- [`server`](./server/): `arkd` Ark server - the always-on daemon

## Development

For detailed development instructions, including running tests, and contributing to the implementations, please refer to the README files in the `server` and `client` directories.

### Compile binary from source

To compile Ark binaries from source, you can use the following Make commands from the root of the monorepo:

- `make build-server`: Builds the `arkd` binary (Ark Service Provider)
- `make build-client`: Builds the `ark` binary (Single-key wallet CLI)
- `make build-wasm`: Builds the WebAssembly bindings
- `make build`: Builds all components for the current architecture (server, client, and WebAssembly SDK)
- `make build-all`: Cross-compile all components for all supported architectures

For example, to build both the server and client binaries, run:

```sh
make build
```

This will compile the `arkd` and `ark` binaries for your current architecture. For more detailed build instructions and options, please refer to the README files in the `server` and `client` directories.

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **No force pushing in PRs**: Always use `git push --force-with-lease` to avoid overwriting others' work.
2. **Sign your commits**: Use GPG to sign your commits for verification.
3. **Squash and merge**: When merging PRs, use the "Squash and merge" option to maintain a clean commit history.
4. **Testing**: Add tests for each new major feature or bug fix.
5. **Keep master green**: The master branch should always be in a passing state. All tests must pass before merging.

### Local Development Setup

1. Install Go (version 1.18 or later)
2. Install [Nigiri](https://nigiri.vulpem.com/) for local Bitcoin and Liquid networks
3. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ark-network/ark.git
   cd ark
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   go work sync
   ```

5. Build the project:

   ```sh
   cd server
   make build
   cd ../client
   make build
   ```

Note: You need to run `make build` in both the `server` and `client` directories separately.
